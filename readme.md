# Personal Portfolio project
## a functional example of a portfolio containing certain elements for examination

This project was for a Level 4 Web Developer examination.
The project was to build a basic web page of your bio.
Semantic elemenst had to be included along with CSS styling to make the page look good with colors and different fonts and styles.
Hyperlinks created for mail, tel and id tags on the sticky menu. Extra hyperlink included to take you back to teh top of the page after each section.
All hyperlinks have a graphical function attached via the CSS file when you hover over them.
A non-working contact form had to be included so a potential visitor can contact you. A button submitting the form is also styled using CSS.

Pictures and text included showing inline to put them side by side rather than a vertical format. This is all done in the linked CSS file.

Layout has a consistant color coding which matches my company website.
